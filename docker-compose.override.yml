    # If you want the Nginx unit status page visible from the
    # outside of the container add the following port mapping:
    # - "8001:8081"
    # healthcheck:
      # Time for which the health check can fail after the container is started.
      # This depends mostly on the performance of your database. On the first start,
      # when all tables need to be created the start_period should be higher than on
      # subsequent starts. For the first start after major version upgrades of NetBox
      # the start_period might also need to be set higher.
